                <p>Membership to Massavu Investment Club offers individuals the opportunity to pool their resources and save collectively towards real estate investments. To join, members contribute an initial fee of 20,000UGX followed by monthly payments of 100,000UGX. At the end of the year, the accumulated funds are invested in real estate ventures. Should a member join midway through the year or after the year has elapsed, they are required to pay the previous monthly contributions before resuming regular payments. This model fosters financial discipline, collective wealth accumulation, and the prospect of lucrative real estate investments for all participants.

                <h2>Member benefits</h2>
                <p>Access to Investment Opportunities: Joining the investment club grants members access to investment opportunities that they may not have been able to pursue individually. This includes opportunities in real estate and potentially other asset classes, depending on the club's investment strategy.</p>
                <p>Diversification: By pooling funds with other members, individuals can achieve greater diversification in their investment portfolio. Investing in real estate alongside other assets held by the club can help spread risk and potentially increase returns over time.</p>
                <p>Educational Opportunities: Membership in an investment club can provide educational benefits, such as learning from other members' investment experiences, guest speakers, or educational materials provided by the club.</p>
                <p>Potential Returns: Members have the potential to earn returns on their investments based on the performance of the club's portfolio. At the end of the year, when the club invests the pooled funds in real estate, members may receive dividends, distributions, or other returns generated by the investments.</p>
